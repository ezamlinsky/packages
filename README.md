# Info
This repository contains a set of build scripts for Arch Linux ABS systems. It is a small part of my own modifications of the official Arch Linux build scripts, which allows you to customize package dependencies, and recompile the software with non default optimization flags.

# Why?
Arch Linux is very flexible and stable distro, which is good enough to turn your Linux based machine into extremely fast WorkStation. And it is what I'm trying to do here.
If you find these build scripts are good for you, or would like to improve them in a some way, then you are welcome to do it.
